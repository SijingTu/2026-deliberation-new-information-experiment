\section{Introduction}
This manuscript records the thoughts on the deliberation process, based on the works of \cite{fain2017sequential}.
In summary, we consider the following possible extensions. We first briefly list them then we will discuss the concrete settings in the latter sections.
\begin{itemize}
\item Due to peer pressure, the agents may not participate in the deliberation (nash bargaining) using their true stance. Does the deliberation still yields a constant distortion guarantee under this new setting?
\item Extend the current setting to the case that there are multiple winners. 
\item Consider the social cost function to be more general, for instance, the $1$-center or the $1$-median problem (or even more general). Does the current approach still obtains constant distortion guarantees under these new social cost functions?
\end{itemize}
